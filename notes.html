<!-- *******IT'S ALL ABOUT COMPONENTS, STATES AND PROPS, and remember that a render can only essentially display 1 parent element, if we want to render multiple parent elements, they have to be wrapped in a div. Remember to use ".bind(this)" when passing functions or methods around. Whenever we're binding a value, we'll also set up a change listener for that, so that it actually changes when the value changes. Also, css-like design elements with hyphens are camelCase in React JSX and should be made into a component, and then implemented, in order for them to function.*******
******FLUX is a pattern. CADS, Components, Actions, Dispatcher, Stores and it cycles again.******
******Remember, when listening to events on mount, to also unmount them to prevent memory leaks.******
